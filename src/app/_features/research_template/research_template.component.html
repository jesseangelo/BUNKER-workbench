  <!-- Notes Phil Town Valuation Checklist Historical growth rate is reasonably
  consistent look for a constant rise 7-10 year projected growth rate is
  reasonably predictable We only get paid for cash flow in the future. You
  should know that industry and business will be around for a long time. Using
  the past growth, but also moat and context of industry. Should be pretty
  simple and obvious - jumping over a 6 inch bar. P/E ratio for a bull market
  sale in 10 years is reasonable and historical Falls within normal range, but
  we'd likely SELL during a bull market MARR is 15% Find the TTM EPS Is this
  reasonable or inflated somehow? Did they just sell half their business or
  acquire another company? Where does it come from exactly? Has it grown? Find
  FCF per share TTM Any factors affecting this? Find owner's cashflow TTM Don't
  ignore latest data, use TTM VALUE IT - Calculate MOS, PBT, Cap rate MOS on
  website PBT on website Owner's cash flow at 10 cap rate (owner's earning /
  market cap) operating cash flow: 406.16M (from cash flow statement) maintaince
  cap ex (investing activities for maintenence may have to read, can take total
  and subtract growth to get this) 48M operating cash flow - maintenance cap ex
  = 406 - 48 = 358 market cap: 12.952B cap rate is owner's cash / market cap;
