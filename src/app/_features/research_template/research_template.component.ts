Notes

Phil Town Valuation Checklist
Historical growth rate is reasonably consistent look for a constant rise
7-10 year projected growth rate is reasonably predictable We only get paid for cash flow in the future. You should know that industry and business will be around for a long time. Using the past growth, but also moat and context of industry. Should be pretty simple and obvious - jumping over a 6 inch bar.
P/E ratio for a bull market sale in 10 years is reasonable and historical Falls within normal range, but we'd likely SELL during a bull market
MARR is 15%
Find the TTM EPS Is this reasonable or inflated somehow? Did they just sell half their business or acquire another company? Where does it come from exactly? Has it grown?
Find FCF per share TTM Any factors affecting this?
Find owner's cashflow TTM Don't ignore latest data, use TTM
VALUE IT - Calculate MOS, PBT, Cap rate
MOS on website
PBT on website
Owner's cash flow at 10 cap rate (owner's earning / market cap)
operating cash flow: 406.16M (from cash flow statement)
maintaince cap ex (investing activities for maintenence may have to read, can take total and subtract growth to get this) 48M
operating cash flow - maintenance cap ex = 406 - 48 = 358
market cap: 12.952B
cap rate is owner's cash / market cap; 358 / 1,295 = 27.64%
